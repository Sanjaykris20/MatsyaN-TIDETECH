## 🧠 Problem Statement

Overfishing and non-sustainable practices threaten marine ecosystems, especially around urban coasts like Chennai.  
Despite efforts, there’s a lack of personalized tools for fishers and citizens to calculate the ecological impact of their fishing methods.

> **How might we encourage sustainable fishing by giving users real-time, gamified feedback on their fishing behavior?**

Our solution? A simple, offline-ready web app that guides them with eco-score feedback, encourages good fishing practices, and even rewards them!

🌍 Sustainable fishing made accessible.

## 🌐 Aligned With UN SDGs
